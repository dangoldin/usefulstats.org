# Useful Stats

{{< columns >}}
## What is it?

As I come across various interesting stats I'll jot them down and add them here.

<--->

## How do I use it?

Right now they're all manually entered through [https://github.com/dangoldin/usefulstats.org](https://github.com/dangoldin/usefulstats.org) but at some point I'll see about making it dynamic with a built in search.

{{< /columns >}}

Get started by checking out a few starting [stats](docs/stats/) to get a sense of what I'm trying to do here.
